# Youtube Simple Shortcuts

This is a small chrome extension that adds a few shortcuts. My motivation was that
videos were always playing at a different speed than I wanted and I wanted an easy
way to fix that without the need to use a trackpad.

### Controls

Note: Only works on youtube.com

`shift + L` - Click the like button

`shift + [` - Slow down the video by 0.25 (to a minimum of 0.25 times normal speed)

`shift + ]` - Speed down the video by 0.25 (to a maximum of 2 times normal speed)

`shift + S` - Sets the video to 16 times normal speed (to be used for ads)


### How to use
To add this to your chrome browser, follow these steps

1. Download all of these files to your computer.
2. Open Chrome
3. Settings > More Tools > Extensions
4. Click `Load unpacked` in the top left
5. Choose the folder where you that is holding the `manifest.json` file and the `content.js` file (They should be in the same folder)
6. Close and Reopen chrome and the bookmark should be active
